# Raspberry PI Home Server
This is my Raspberry PI 2 home server. It acts as [a DNS server](https://github.com/reynico/my-raspberry/tree/master/bind), [Dynamic update DNS client](https://github.com/reynico/my-raspberry/tree/master/ddclient), [IRC chat client](https://github.com/reynico/my-raspberry/tree/master/irssi), [Nginx webserver and proxy](https://github.com/reynico/my-raspberry/tree/master/nginx) and [OpenVPN server](https://github.com/reynico/my-raspberry/tree/master/openvpn). All of this running over Arch Linux ARM.
### To-do
* Implement docker containers (may need a hardware upgrade)
* Implement automation using Ansible
* Implement OpenVPN user creation/delete/manage
